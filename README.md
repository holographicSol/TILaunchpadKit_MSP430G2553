In CCS:

1: File -> New Project -> CCS -> CCS Project.

2: Select Target (MSP430Gxxx Family -> MSP430G2553).

2: Name the new project associated with the example you wish to run.

3: Select Empty Project (with main.c)

4: Overwrite/Paste main.c into project.

Configuring CCS to flash the microcontroller is outside the scope of these instructions.
